nevermind, let's do induction on formulas:
	each formula:
		applies
		or
		doesn't apply

	applies if:
		each selector is bound (ignoring actual fact values for now)

	doesn't apply if:
		each selector is paired with a hypothetical fact and the fact is dif'd to all real facts

^^ nvm



==============







termination:
the introduction of a helper argument for overthrowing ep-checking can possibly be seen equivalent to proving termination of a function? Should we look at ep-cuts as bugs?



====




the list of facts is terminated by the same predicate that concludes that no more applications can be made. Or at least, the open list where formulas can generate new facts into.


for each formula:
	for each selector:
		partition the list of facts into those that match and those that dont (those that dif)

===========





=============
===

	The requirement that each item should be unique could probably be formalized like this:

	set(List, Cell) :-
		/* probably with the help of a marker symmetric to nil:*/

		Prev rdf:rest Cell
		maplist_backwards(cell_has_item_different_from(This_item), Prev)
		...

	cell_has_item_different_from(Cell, Diff) :-
		Cell rdf:first X
		dif(X, Diff).
	...
===





xbrl (formulas) semantics are their own inference model:
	iterate over all facts
		iterate over all formulas
			match input facts
			produce new facts
	repeat until no new facts are being added


but we want to model everything with rules interpreted in one semantic, that of the datalog with E-rules, so that the application of formulas can be just a one part of a larger search. For example, it is unknown how many persons there are in a SMSF fund, so the engine goes back and forth between...


i can't seem to be able to figure out how to model the application cycle within the datalog's semantics.


why i'm trying to stick to the semantics:
1) it has the power to infer back and forth between rules with mathematical calculations and rules about structure of the result (model).
2) there is a clear set of possible outcomes:
* all results found
* no results found
* still running

"no results found" is very interesting for us, as it translates to "your inputs are invalid, they fail to validate against your (mathematical and structural) rules", and it specifically doesn't translate to: we're not sure if this engine can handle the task, maybe your inputs are valid but the engine can't make the connection.




3 options:
### run the application engine extralogically
it would be able to run only if some conditions are satisfied, namely, ...


###








members of a fund:

the assets of the fund must equal the sum of equities of its members

may be expressed as a summation calculation in xbrl


the interesting case that we should be able to solve is when we dont know how many members there are


Ledger model valid :-
	Ledger facts Facts
	Ledger smsf_members Members
	smsf_rules Facts Members


smsf_rules Facts Members :-
	member(Member, Members),
	member(Fact, Facts),
	Fact attributes [member Member, concept "equity"]
