# IDEs, visualization:

## probably not worth trying

### https://github.com/rebornix/vscode-prolog
dead

### https://sicstus.sics.se/spider/

### http://www.amzi.com/AmziOpenSource/downloads.php and http://interprolog.com/interprolog-studio/
could have some merit, but are far from mature / working out of the box

## passable

### emacs prolog mode
 - with some more time spent configuring keyboard macros, could be a nice simple editor with syntax highlighting, jump-to-error, and bad audoindentation that can't be disabled

### https://sewiki.iai.uni-bonn.de/research/pdt/docs/start
Some kind of prolog-aware text search. Finds all invocations, let's you kinda go from declaration to invocation and back, but clumsy. Nice module dependency graph. Not too active but not dead.

### https://github.com/arthwang/vsc-prolog
more or less no functionality besides syntax highlighting works. Vscode is a joke, but tolerable.

### Kate
have to switch mode to prolog for syntax highlighting. Support for multiple open files, search&replace across files etc. 

### Intellij with logtalk plugin and a couple of extra language-agnostic highlighting plugins

## maybe?
### https://github.com/likelion/swiprolog
had success compiling, doesn't seem to work, but maybe could be brought up to date. 

##prolog language server + intellij language server client:
didnt work, LSP is not much of a standard

## logtalk can generate graphs probably directly from pure prolog
logtalk itself doesn't play well with gtrace
