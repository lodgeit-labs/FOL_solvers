# accounting for developers

the accounting equation is maybe better expressed as "(magnitude of) assets = (magnitude of) debt to owner (equity; owner is the creditor) + (magnitude of) debt to others (liabilities; other creditors)"

so, the accounting equation would really be "the amount the company owes (debit) = the amount that has been credited to it (credits, from the perspective of the creditors)" and the subdivision of the RHS is by creditor, which is one way to subdivide assets by "role"

Focus on getting right basic building blocks of thinking. This is well explained in the papers, worth reading.
The system is then left to interact with a model world through some input and output channels, and left to
make random inferences and actions, and relies on feedback (probably has or should have some innate reward feedback for discovering relations / causing new kinds of changes in the world?)
